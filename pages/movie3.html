            In AD 859, as the Tang dynasty declines, several rebel
            groups emerged. The largest of them is the House of Flying Daggers in Fengtian, who battle the corrupt
            government. Its members steal from the rich and give to the poor, gaining the locals' support. Two police
            officers, Leo and Jin, are ordered to kill the group leader within ten days, an impossible task given no one
            even knows the leader's identity.
